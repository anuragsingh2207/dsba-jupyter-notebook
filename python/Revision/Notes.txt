Notes:

+++Numbers+++
There are four numeric Python data type
a. int (signed integers)
b. float (floating point real values)
c. long (long integers, they can also be represented in octal and hexadecimal)
d. complex (complex numbers)

+++Strings+++
Strings are immutable.
string1[1]

+++List+++
List is collection objects in a given order. Lists are mutable. 
list1 = []

Can be accessed via list1[5]

List Operations
append()=> add items at the end of the list
insert() => insert new element at index
extend() => concat two list
del => delete items
remove() => search and delete
pop() => remove last items
reverse()=> reverse the list

+++Tuple+++
Tuple is collection of objects in a given order and unchangeable.
Tuples provide faster iteration compared to lists.

tuple1 = ()

del => deletes tuple; you can't delete elements in tuple

Tuple Operations
count()=> finds the appearence/count of an element passed within a tuple
index()=> finds index of element passed
sorted()=> sorts the tuple

+++Dictionary+++
Dictionary is unordered collection of items stored in key-value pair.


dictionary_name = { key_1: value_1,
                    key_2: value_2,
                    key_3: value_3,
                    }
                    
Can be accessed via dict[key]

Dictionary Operations
pop() method
popitem() method
del keywords
clear keyword


+++Sets+++

Collection of unique elements. {}

x = set()

Set Operations

add() => add items to set
update() => add multiple items to set
len() => length of set
remove() => remove an item from set
discard() => remove an item from set
isdisjoint() => to check disjoint set [A disjoint set is one which does not have any common elements with other ste]
union() => joins two sets but still shows the unique out of both the sets
& => intersection to find common elements between two sets
- => difference between two sets
