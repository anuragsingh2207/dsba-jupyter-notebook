    "The data file is attached as csv file. The following are details being provided . The data contains details on actual productivty of a garment industry, the data has been recorded on a day to day basis from the year 2015 to almost year end of 2015. The data set at first needs to be examined and the structure of the data set needs to be understood. The data has been recorded in terms of the following details\n",

    "Quarter (Four Quarters)\n",
    "Department (Sewing and Finishing)\n",
